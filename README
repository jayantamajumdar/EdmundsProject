Project to assess customer sentiment toward entry level luxury sedans on Edmunds.com forums. Included are a crawler for the forum itself, a replacement list to capture as much information as possible about each brand and attribute pairing and finally a lift value for each brand and attribute pairing. These lifts reflect how the different brands are viewed by customers across numerous dimensions, and the final LiftFeatureMatrix produced from the LiftFeatureCalculator holds these values.
